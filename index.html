                <p id='intro'>Tiny leaders Reignited is a web page dedicated to 
                    keeping current banlist updates and format 
                    asjustments for the Tiny Leaders format which has been without 
                    guidance for many years. 
                </p>
                <h2 id='what-is-tiny-leaders'>What is Tiny Leaders?</h2>
                <p> To quote the original Tiny Leaders blog post: "The rules 
                    are simple- 50 card decks, including your "Commander", 
                    with no more than one of each card (a "Highlander" format), 
                    and no card shall exceed converted mana cost 3."
                </p>
                </br>
                <p> Additionally, Tiny Leaders decks have access to a 10 card sideboard.</p>
                <h2 id='rules'>What are the rules?</h2>
                    <p>While the scentence above gives a good summary of the rules,
                        a more detailed list can be found below. For any rules questions not
                        covered by the below list, please refer to the Commander rules. 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Tiny Leaders is a 1v1, best-of-three format</li>
                        <li>Players begin the game with 25 life</li>
                        <li>Decks are comprised of 50 cards including the commander</li>
                        <li>No more than one of each card</li>
                        <li>No card can cost more than 3 mana</li>
                        <li>Your commander can be a legendary creature (or 2 in the case 
                            of cards with the partner ability) or a cmc 3 or less planeswalker.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each card in a deck must not have mana symbols not found in 
                            their commander's color identity</li>
                        <li>Each deck can have a sideboard of up to 10 cards. 
                            Commanders can not be changed between games.</li>
                        <li>Commanders start in the Command Zone and are cast under normal timing 
                            restrictions. Owners must pay 2 generic mana more to cast their commander 
                            for each time that commander has been cast from the Command Zone that game. 
                        </li>
                        <li>If a commander is put into your graveyard or the exile zone, you may chose to leave it
                            there or move it to the Command Zone. 
                        </li>
